// The plane can be tiled with a "honeycomb" of hexagons. The only other
// regular polygons that can do so are squares and equilateral triangles
// (and the latter only work if half of them are oriented "upside-down").
// 
// This script shows how the turtle can cover the plane with hexagonal tiles
// by winding around an initial hexagon in a continuous spiral. Two different
// but interlocking tile designs are alternated on successive loops of the
// spiral, and the colors used are gradually altered.
//  
// Why not try redesigning the tyle types, or create a new one and try adding
// it to the pattern? (There are some hints in the comments.) Make your design
// a similar size to the hexagon, and remember when drawing a tile that
// the turtle starts and ends at the bottom-left vertex, facing north!

/// This pattern is very pretty at high resolution - it's better with
/// a couple more loops to the spiral, so that the color change is more
/// gradual and the inner and outer hexagons blend together better.
